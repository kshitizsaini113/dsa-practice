# Sorting

A Sorting Algorithm is used to rearrange a given array or list of elements according to a comparison operator on the elements. The comparison operator is used to decide the new order of elements in the respective data structure.

## Sorting Algorithms
1. Selection Sort
2. Stable Selection Sort
3. Bubble Sort
4. Insertion Sort
5. Recursive Bubble Sort
6. Recursive Insertion Sort
7. Merge Sort
8. Quick Sort

> Of all these ***Merge Sort*** is the best sorting algorithm

| Algorithm                     | Time Complexity | Space Complexity | Stability     |
|-------------------------------|-----------------|------------------|---------------|
| **Selection Sort**            | O(n^2)          | O(1)             | Not Stable    |
| **Stable Selection Sort**     | O(n^2)          | O(1)             | Stable        |
| **Bubble Sort**               | O(n^2)          | O(1)             | Stable        |
| **Insertion Sort**            | O(n^2)          | O(1)             | Stable        |
| **Recursive Bubble Sort**     | O(n^2)          | O(n)             | Stable        |
| **Recursive Insertion Sort**  | O(n^2)          | O(n)             | Stable        |
| **Merge Sort**                | O(n log n)      | O(n)             | Stable        |
| **Quick Sort**                | O(n log n)      | O(log n)         | Not Stable    |
